# Automation and Monitoring

### Automate Actions and Monitoring your Scans

After File Storage Security completes a scan, the scan results are tagged to the file and published to the SNS ```ScanResultTopic```.

If you want to do more with the results, you'll have to create or add an action to take place after the scan. We provide many samples of integrations that can be done with Cloud One File Storage Security in our GitHub page, one of the most used Post-Action is the ability to send clean files to one Amazon S3 bucket (promote) and send malicious files to another Amazon S3 bucket (quarantine). We also provide an API to help with creating your own post-scan actions.
