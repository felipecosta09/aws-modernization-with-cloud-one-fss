### Cloud Object Storage (Amazon S3)

Back in March/2006, when Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) was launched and created the first generally available AWS service, over the time, data storage and usage has exploded, and the world has never been the same. Amazon S3 has virtually unlimited scalability, and unmatched availability, durability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use S3 to store any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

### Increasing Cloud-Native Storage Adoption

Cloud storage is a major component of creating a cloud-native application today, as it affects performance, cost, scalability, availability, manageability, durability, and security. With the increase in cloud-native application development and the importance of file upload and transfer, file storage services are a logical choice for modern business requirements. With the speed of DevOps and growing internal application teams, many security engineers are not as engaged or aware of all the security gaps that may exist in their business domain. Consequently, this leads to a lack of insight and resources to monitor ongoing adoption and growth of storage systems across development environments. This extended pressure requires attentiveness and guardrails that will help an organization avoid security risk and breaches.
