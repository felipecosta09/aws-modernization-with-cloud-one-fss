	"content": " Cloud Object Storage (S3) Back in March/2006, when Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) was launched and created the first generally available AWS service, over the time, data storage and usage has exploded, and the world has never been the same. Amazon S3 has virtually unlimited scalability, and unmatched availability, durability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use S3 to store any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.\n Increasing Cloud-Native Storage Adoption Cloud storage is a major component of creating a cloud-native application today, as it affects performance, cost, scalability, availability, manageability, durability, and security. With the increase in cloud-native application development and the importance of file upload and transfer, file storage services are a logical choice for modern business requirements. With the speed of DevOps and growing internal application teams, many security engineers are not as engaged or aware of all the security gaps that may exist in their business domain. Consequently, this leads to a lack of insight and resources to monitor ongoing adoption and growth of storage systems across development environments. This extended pressure requires attentiveness and guardrails that will help an organization avoid security risk and breaches.\nThe examples and sample code provided in this workshop are intended to be consumed as instructional content. These will help you understand how various Trend Micro - Cloud One and AWS services can be architected to build a solution while demonstrating best practices along the way.  "

	"content": " File Storage Security File Storage Security is part of the Trend Micro Cloud One™ security service platform, helping your organization to build and run applications securely by offering controls that work across your existing infrastructure or modern code streams, development toolchains, and multiplatform requirements. File Storage Security helps ensure your Amazon S3 buckets are free from malware by deploying cloud-native security that can be integrated into your custom Amazon S3 workflows.\nFile Storage Security is backed by Trend Micro Research, which continuously monitors and collects threat data from across the globe by employing advanced detection analytics to immediately block attacks before they can harm your organization.\nUnderstanding How Trend Micro Can Help Secure Your Object Storage There are two main ways to use File Storage Security in your AWS Infrastructure:\n File Upload Scan -\u0026gt; Any cloud-native application that uses the power of the cloud to provide features integrated with Amazon S3 buckets could be exposed to malware. File Storage Security allows customers to integrate scan capabilities directly to their AWS accounts, so all of the files you receive in your Amazon S3 buckets from external sources can be scanned for malware before your application can consume the data.\n Automated Workflow -\u0026gt; Development teams leverage event-driven designs with Amazon S3 to automate the processing of data uploaded to a bucket. File Storage Security was designed with this architecture in mind allowing development teams to seamlessly integrate file scanning into their automated workflow.\n  Architecture Cloud-native application architectures incorporate cloud file/object storage services into their workflow, creating a new attack vector where they are vulnerable to malicious files. File Storage Security protects the workflow through innovative techniques, such as malware scanning, integration into your custom workflows, and broad cloud storage platform support – freeing you to go further and do more. File Storage Security provides flexible implementation options, including a multi-bucket promotional model (scanning bucket to quarantine/clean bucket) or an efficient single-bucket architecture.\nFile Storage Security’s architecture was built to be simple to understand and monitor all of the buckets. As soon as a new file is uploaded to the bucket, this will generate a SQS message inside your AWS account that will trigger an AWS Lambda function. The function will execute the scan and tag the file as malicious or clean, depending on the scan result. It is also possible to connect plugins to perform additional actions, for example, as soon the file is tagged as malicious, the plugin moves the tagged file to a quarantine bucket.\nDigging a little deeper into the architecture details, the overall deployment is made up of two different stacks:\n Storage Stack -\u0026gt; This stack is responsible for accepting the notification for the Amazon S3 bucket, as well as sending newly uploaded files to the Scanner Stack for the security scan. After the scan is complete, an Amazon SNS topic is published and the file is tagged as “malicious” or “clean”—additional plugins are available to add more functionality to the stack.\n Scanner Stack -\u0026gt; This stack is responsible for executing the scan and publishing the results to the Amazon SNS ScanResultTopic. When the Scanner Stack receives the request from the Storage Stack, its processes it and uses an AWS Lambda function to execute the scan. Like many Trend Micro technologies, File Storage Security can leverage Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ for the latest threat information.\n  In order to launch both stacks, you must leverage the following CloudFormation Templates: FSSScanner-Stack.template and FSS-Storage-Stack.template. We also offer an all-in-one stack that launches both, called FSS-All-In-One.template. To help security and DevOps teams automate their workflows with File Storage Security, all CloudFormation Templates are available in our GitHub repository. For additional plugins, we have created a separate GitHub repository to enable you to add more functionality, including post-scan actions to permit files to either be pass or be quarantined.  "

First of all, make sure that all the requirements are meet, then:\nGo to Cloud One File Storage Security, here: https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/filestorage/deployment, it will request the login information for the Cloud One, in case you don\u0026rsquo;t have it, check the requirements page that has all the details that you will need.\nClick on \u0026ldquo;Deploy\u0026rdquo; and select Scanner Stack and Storage Stack, to deploy the full solution to your AWS account.\nSelect the AWS region that best suit for you and click on Launch Stack, this will redirect you to your AWS account in the region that you choose to deploy the stack. Make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re logged in and has the correct permissions, you can check the details of the permissions required in the Requirements section.\nYou can verify the Cloud Formation code by clicking in Review Stack, to make it easier, you can also verify the CLoud Formation code by clicking the buttons below:\n All in One Template  Scanner Stack  Storage Stack  In the Cloud Formation page the only required parameter here is the name of choose bucket, which is represented by the S3BucketToScan. It also supports differents parameters to customize your installation, like Resource prefixes and optional KMS integration, for more details about these check our Documentation.\nAfter deploying the all-in-one stack, you must configure the scanner and storage stack Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The ARNs map a scanner stack to a storage stack, allowing them to be aware of each other.\nGo to CloudFormation \u0026gt; Stacks \u0026gt; your all-in-one stack \u0026gt; Outputs tab and copy and paste the ScannerStackManagementRoleARN and StorageStackManagementRoleARN into the File Storage Security console.\nThen Click Submit.
